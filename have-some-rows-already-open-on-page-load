How to pick and choose which table rows are already open on page load...

Add the following javascript:

	$(document).ready(function() {
	  setTimeout(function() {
	    $("#load-opened a.act-more.act-collapsed").trigger('click');
			}, 10);
	});
  
  This is saying that once the page has loaded, we're going to isolate 
  the button that needs to be clicked to open up the table row, and 
  then any table row that has the id "load-opened" will then be triggered and clicked.
  
  Then you add the following code:
  
  id="load-opened" 
  
  to every table row in the html file, that you want to be opened when the page loads.
  
  My first row looks like this...
  
  <tr class="pricing-row" id="load-opened" data-id="1" data-parent="">
